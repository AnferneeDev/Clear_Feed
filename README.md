Clear Feed allows users to watch content from their favorite channels without the distraction of recommendations, autoplay, or comments, creating a calmer, more intentional viewing experience.📖 Table of ContentsAbout The Project✨ Core Features📸 Demo🛠️ Tech Stack🚀 Getting Started🚢 Deployment📜 License📧 Contact🎯 About The ProjectThis project was born from the idea that social media can be a tool, not a trap. Modern platforms are engineered to maximize user engagement, often at the expense of the user's time and focus.Clear Feed's purpose is to reclaim that focus. By acting as a clean interface for platforms like YouTube, it removes the unnecessary information (like algorithm-driven recommendations) and provides a direct, uncluttered feed of content you've chosen to watch.✨ Core FeaturesDistraction-Free Viewing: Paste any YouTube channel URL and get a clean, chronological feed of its videos.No Recommendations: The app does not show "recommended for you" videos, breaking the cycle of endless consumption.High-Performance Caching: Utilizes a persistent Redis cache (via Upstash) to deliver a blazing-fast user experience and efficiently manage YouTube API quotas.Production-Ready: Built with a professional mindset, incorporating error tracking with Sentry and a modular architecture for maintainability.📸 DemoCheck out the live website: https://clear-feed.vercel.app<!-- IMPORTANT: Add a screenshot or, even better, a GIF of your app in action here. --><!-- Create an assets/images folder in your repo and add your GIF to it. -->🛠️ Tech StackThis project leverages a modern, professional tech stack:Framework: Next.js (React)Authentication: ClerkUI Components: shadcn/uiAnimations: Magic UIStyling: Tailwind CSSCaching: Redis (Upstash)Monitoring: SentryCode Quality: ESLint & Prettier🚀 Getting StartedThis guide provides instructions for setting up the project locally.PrerequisitesNode.js (v18.x or later recommended)npm or yarnGitLocal SetupClone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/AnferneeDev/Clear_Feed.git](https://github.com/AnferneeDev/Clear_Feed.git)
